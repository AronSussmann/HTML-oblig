    <h1>Oblig1
        Data1100 
    </h1>
    <p>Below you will find the assignment for this module, or lecture.
        You answer the assignment by filling in the form.
        The form includes 7 steps that will guide your discussions. Each step includes a short description of what
        you should do. It also includes a suggested timeframe for each step. You fill in the form by way of keywords
        or full paragraphs. Use sources, when necessary, there is a section at the end for references. Preferably use
        the style of APA7th. Each step is given an approximate word count, meant as a guideline, rather than
        absolute criteria. 
    </p>

    <p>Before you start solving the assignment, you need to distribute roles in the group:
        -	There needs to be a group leader, for this assignment, who is responsible for reading out the assignment and following the 7 steps.  
        -	A note-taker, which does the writing, saves the document and hands it in, in Canvas, when you have finished the assignment.
        -	A timekeeper, which assures that you stay within the allocated time frame.
        -	All other members of the group must be stated under “other members” by their full name. 
        -	Only members of the group that have their name on this assignment, and hence have actually participated in the discussion, can get a pass and include the assignment as 1 of 5 obligatory assignments qualifying for the exam.
